If you're low on defense, by this point equipping food to stay alive is normal and expected. \n Bowman's core concept is \"SpeedNA\", gives damage based on every 15% movement speed so we're aiming for 145% with \"Featherweight\" & \"Strafe\". \n Priority is \"Featherweight\" to 20, then \"Gilded Sword\" > \"Sharpened Axe\". Excess points may be placed into Agi or \"Broken Time\"."
