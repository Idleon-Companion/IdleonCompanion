        '*1 = Boost STR to have as much accuracy as you need for the best AFK gains. Usually this will be the farthest monster you can reach without dying. If you\'re low on defense, by this point equipping food to stay alive is normal and expected. \n"Idle Shooting" to 100 for 13% AFK gain rate. \n Bowman\'s core concept is "SpeedNA" gives damage based on every 15% movement speed so we\'re aiming for 145% with "Featherweight" & "Strafe". Priority is "Featherweight" to 20 > "Gilded Sword" & "Sharpened Axe". \n *2 = Excess points may go here.',
