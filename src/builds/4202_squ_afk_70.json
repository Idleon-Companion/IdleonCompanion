  "comment_one": "*1 = Boost WIS to have as much accuracy as you need for the best AFK gains. Usually this will be the farthest monster you can reach without dying. If you're low on defense, by this point equipping food to stay alive is normal and expected.\n\"Idle Brawling\" to 100 for 13% AFK gain rate.\nPriority switches to Gilded sword > Meatshank > Sharpened axe",
  "comment_two": "Level \"Carry A Big Stick\" to 100, then your active damage skills to 55. Afterwards, bring \"Double-Strike\" up to 41.\n*1 = Spread excess points equally between \"Absolute Unit\" and \"Strength In Numbers\".\n 1 point into \"Firmly Grasp It\" gives extra STR.",
