If you're low on defense, by this point equipping food to stay alive is normal and expected. \n Max \"Gilded Sword\" & \"Sharpened Axe\". \n *2 = Get 430 **mana to sustain active talents. \n *3 = Excess points may be placed into preferably Agi, can do HP/Def, or \"Broken Time\".",
  "comment_two": "Level 40 \"Piercing Arrow\" to be able to hit 3 mobs, and 1 point into kick. Max \"High Polymer Limbs\" followed by 40 points into \"Have Another\" & 100 into \"Veins of the Infernal\". \n *1 = Excess points may be put into HP/MP, Smithing EXP, or more Agi.",
  "comment_three": "Put 30 points into \"Bear Trap\" for an additional trap placed, 1 into \"360 NOSCOPE\", 40 into \"Have Another... Again\", then get \"Looty McShooty\" maxed. \n *1 = With 430 mana, uwu rawr can be sustained and points should be put in (or \"Eagle Eye\"). \n *2 = Points can be taken away from \"Uwu Rawr\" to make room for \"Eagle Eye\".
