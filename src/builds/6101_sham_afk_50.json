  "comment_two": "You want to level up \"Energy bolt\" and \"Mini fireball\" to about 50\n\"Power overwhelming\", \"Individual insight\" and \"Knowledge is power\" have less priority in afk builds.",
  "comment_three": "Level up the damaging skills evenly. \n Put 20-30 points into \"Virile Vials\" (skip this part if you dont have many green vials.)",
  "notes": "Active Skills directly increase AFK damage (multiplicative). The damage cap for a zone is the Monsterâ€™s HP. AFK damage increases above this cap will not increase your gains. AFK Damage = Minimum damage * Active Skill AFK multiplier",
